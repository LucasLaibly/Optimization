    "\n",
    "The general model represents the heart of our project. We looked to maximize the amount of money that could be potentially attained after one week of stock trading. Much like the traveling salesman problem, this is grossly impossible on the surface. So to make it more manageable, the assumptions we make are that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We know how much the stock is going to sell for on each closing day\n",
    "2. We set boundaries that a person cannot go broke (have less than 0 dollars) to buy stock and\n",
    "3. Our starting amount of money on hand to buy stock is 100,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these assumptions in mind, we begin to think of how to strucutre our base model. In the following program we set our first day seperate from the rest of the week tradings. This is because on the first day we have nothing to sell, and we should only buy. With the current model, we can more accurately force actions of buying and selling to occur through out the set amount of time. "

    "The solution to the problem is rather exhaustive as our general solution above looks at the volatility of going from the first day to the last day. This meaning, rather than make actions from the circumstances of each day, we look at where we start and then where we end. Regardless, our solution provides us insight that we are spending every last dollar we can, other than day 4. This is where the general soltuion falls through in that it knows the future. In a real time stock market trading scenario, one does not know the future. We cover this by making the assumption at the start that the program will assume to know the future and then \"in real time\" depecit what to buy and when to sell. \n",
