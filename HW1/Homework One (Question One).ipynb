    "###### 1a. Given the choice of solvers Clp, ECOS, and SCS, which one would you choose and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "I would choose to use Clp. The reason for this is because our given set equations we are looking to optimize does not have a terribly large set of values to work with. Because of this, we are working with a more specialized set of values and therefore we can put more emphasis on speed. We know that SCS is not quite as fast, but Clp does beat out ECOS. We want to acheive a fast solver that can run through specalized values. "
