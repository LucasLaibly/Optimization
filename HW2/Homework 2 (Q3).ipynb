    "We define a strict inequality as an inequality that does not have any \"equals\" partitions. All statements are either less than or greater than. Therefore, if we made our statements above as strict inequality it can be argued that would get an even more ideal solution. As it stands right now, our linear program *could* have $p_{j}^{min}$ == $p_{j}$, thus we would not be minimizing our power usage whatsoever. The same can be said for our illumination equation. Together, we would not have to think about any condition in which case the min is equal to the max. "
