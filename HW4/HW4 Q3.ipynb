    "Apparently the money required to spend each year dropped. I really do not know how else to evaluate this problem, and apparently I am still wrong with what I am trying. Regardless, I would say dont spend more than $6.00 on the supplements per year. If the daily requirment is 0.8g of calcium, and we know the values based on spending a single dollar. It would take 292 grams of calcium to meet the minimum requirement for a year (0.8 * 365). It is a near one to one ratio in dollar spent to gram of calcium. Taking 292 and dividing it by 50 (which is how many grams of calcium come in the supplements with respect to a single dollar) would be about 5.84 dollars in supplements to satisfy this. \n",
